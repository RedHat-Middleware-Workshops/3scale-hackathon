Here are some items our team struggled with during the 3Scale Hackathon.  We'd hoped to get 
to write-up some of this as useful additions to the labs but other priorities got in the way. 
Note: We felt current labs are well written and the focus is about right. These items may well be out of
scope for the main path of the lab. Just here to document our journey during Hackathon.
Hopfully this feedback will provide useful information on some things to emphasize or enhance in 
future versions of these labs. 

1) Regarding Developer portal chapters 03 how would we enable scenario where 
    we use RH-SSO and want to create an API Consumer sign-up flow that give developer's
    ability to self-serve with automatic account creation on signup?  
    This sign-up flow would utilize RH-SSO for sign-up process. This was not addressed in the labs. 
    Per Satya: "what happens is once you have configured RHSSO or any other IdP identities should be primarily 
    managed there. 3scale should delegate the workflow to the IdP. So customers who implement a signup process 
    with 3scale Dev Portal will create a workflow that will redirect the signup to the IdP's signup page."
    As a lab exercise we could enable self creation of account into SSO (from the 3Scale Dev Portal "Sign Up" page) 
    by following the RH SSO documentation for user registration 
    https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.4/html/server_administration_guide/user_management#user-registration


2) When using RHOAM, our team wished to create an APICast instance inside our own namespace, but we fumbled with that procedure. 
    The technique for deploying a tenant-specific API cast was not spelled out explicitely for a RHOAM install 
    https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/3scale-hackathon/blob/master/modules/01_3Scale_Architecture/01_1_Lab_Environment_Lab.adoc#42-explore-tenant-specific-api-gateways
    This process intalled installing apicast into custom namespsace and configuring secret, and pointing apicast back to the default 3scale manager. 


3) There was some confusion regarding prometheous/grafana support in RHOAM for 3Scale. It was unclear what we should expect to see. 
        We weren't seeing much metrics. The Consensus on our team was that by default 3Scale RHOAM should allow visibility in grafana to some meaningful 
        metrics at least metrics for the default gateways apicasts.
        Alerts on Openshift console 3Scale 
        APIcast integration with Prometheus is not available in hosted API manager and hosted APIcast.

        But i did find this which did allow me to access
        https://github.com/evanshortiss/rhoam-introductory-labs/blob/master/walkthroughs/lab-6-3scale-and-cluster-monitoring/walkthrough.adoc
        and
        https://github.com/evanshortiss/rhoam-introductory-labs/blob/master/walkthroughs/lab-3-rate-limit-monitoring/walkthrough.adoc


4) Camel proxy Policy 
    This would make a useful addition to 06 Gateway Policies lab . 
    We were only able to connect to camel proxy from APICast over http not https 
    had to change the camel proxy here:
    https://github.com/zregvart/camel-netty-proxy
    to instead listen on HTTP instead of https 
    And configure the http_proxy to 
    http://camel-netty-proxy.team3-business-services.svc:8080 
    APIcast to communicate with Camel Proxy, SSL cert needs to be added to system part of APICast?? not sure 
    Turned up logging on APICast to DEBUG helped troubleshoot problem

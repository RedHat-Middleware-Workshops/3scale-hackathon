# OCP Environment
1. Start with the OCP 4.8 workshop deployer on RHPDS.
2. `ssh` to the bastion using the SSH password provided in the email.
3. `sudo` as `root` user:
  
  # sudo -i
  
4. Create `3scale-amp` project.

  # oc new-project 3scale-amp

5. Find the resource limits for this project:

  # oc get limitranges
  NAME                              CREATED AT
  3scale-amp-core-resource-limits   2019-12-17T15:33:34Z

6. Edit the resource limit `3scale-amp-core-resource-limits` to change the resource limits as follows. The limit for memory as changed here to `32 GB` to ensure the `redis-*` pods of 3scale are deployed. This is only the max limit and does not affect the requested resources.

  spec:
    limits:
    - default:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 1536Mi
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 256Mi
      max:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: 32Gi
      type: Container
    - max:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: 32Gi
      type: Pod

7. Create `system-storage` PVC using this YAML. Use the correct namespace.

8. Once this is successful, create the API Manager `amp.yaml`

9. Create the API Manager specification `amp-s3.yml`:

10. After few minutes your API Manager Pods will be up and you should be able to access the `3scale-admin` URL.

# Optional:

### SMTP Access
1. Create the `smtp.yml` configmap to configure SMTP access:

  kind: ConfigMap
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: smtp
    labels:
      app: 3scale-api-management
      threescale_component: system
      threescale_component_element: smtp
  data:
    address: 'smtp.gmail.com'
    authentication: 'login'
    domain: 'redhat.com'
    openssl.verify.mode: 'false'
    password: '<< your password>>'
    port: '587'
    username: '<< your userid>>'

2. Add the configmap to `3scale-amp` namespace:

  # oc create -f smtp.yml

3. Once SMTP is updated, redeploy the system pods.
